# ods2csv
This is a Go package to read contents of a .ods (openoffice spreadsheet) file. Formula and value of a cell can be accessed. See example for usage. 
This library is made to demostrate the use of "github.com/LIJUCHACKO/xmlasDatabase" 

Note:= This is more readable, but slower than "github.com/LIJUCHACKO/ods2csv" 

Note: Merged cells are not support
